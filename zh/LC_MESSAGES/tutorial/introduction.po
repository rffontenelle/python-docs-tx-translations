"fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences "
"are false.  The test used in the example is a simple comparison.  The "
"standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: ``<`` (less "

"to), ``>=`` (greater than or equal to) and ``!=`` (not equal to)."

"The *body* of the loop is *indented*: indentation is Python's way of "

"complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors "
"have an auto-indent facility.  When a compound statement is entered "
"interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion "
"(since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line).  Note "
"that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount."
