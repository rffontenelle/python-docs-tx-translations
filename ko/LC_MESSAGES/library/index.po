"While :ref:`reference-index` describes the exact syntax and semantics of the "
"Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard "
"library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the "
"optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions."

"Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of "
"facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The "
"library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to "
"system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible "
"to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide "
"standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. "
"Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the "
"portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into "
"platform-neutral APIs."

"The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire "
"standard library and often also include many additional components. For Unix-"
"like operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of "
"packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with "
"the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components."

msgid ""
"In addition to the standard library, there is an active collection of "
"hundreds of thousands of components (from individual programs and modules to "
"packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the "
"`Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`_."
