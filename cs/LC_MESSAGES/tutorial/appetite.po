"If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there's some task "
"you'd like to automate.  For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-"
"replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch "
"of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you'd like to write a small "
"custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game."

"Při práci s počítačem dříve nebo později dojdete k závěru, že mnohé rutinní "
"čínnosti by stálo za to zautomatizovat. Například můžete chtít provést "
"operaci \"najít a nahradit\" s velkým počtem textových souborů najednou, "
"nebo přejmenovat a uspořádat spoustu souborů s fotografiemi nějakým "
"sofistikovaným způsobem. Možná byste si chtěli napsat vlastní malou "
"databázi, nebo specializovanou grafickou aplikaci, nebo jednoduchou hru."

"If you're a professional software developer, you may have to work with "
"several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-"
"compile cycle is too slow.  Perhaps you're writing a test suite for such a "
"library and find writing the testing code a tedious task.  Or maybe you've "
"written a program that could use an extension language, and you don't want "
"to design and implement a whole new language for your application."

"Pokud je programování vaše profese, nejspíše pracujete v s knihovnami v "
"jazycích jako jsou C, C++, nebo Java, a zdá se vám, že přechod od psaní "
"kódu, přes kompilaci, k testování, a zpět ke kompilaci je příliš pomalý. "
"Možná píšete sadu testů pro takovou knihovnu a psát testovací kód je "
"vyčerpávající. Nebo možná jste napsali program, ke kterému by se vám hodil "
"jazyk pro psaní rozšíření, a nechcete si takový jazyk navrhovat a psát sami."

"You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these "
"tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text "
"data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/"
"Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-"
"draft program.  Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and "
"Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly."

"Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering "
"much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or "
"batch files can offer.  On the other hand, Python also offers much more "
"error checking than C, and, being a *very-high-level language*, it has high-"
"level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.  "
"Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger "
"problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy "
"in Python as in those languages."

"Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in "
"other Python programs.  It comes with a large collection of standard modules "
"that you can use as the basis of your programs --- or as examples to start "
"learning to program in Python.  Some of these modules provide things like "
"file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user "
"interface toolkits like Tk."

"Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time "
"during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.  "
"The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment "
"with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test "
"functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk "
"calculator."

"Python is *extensible*: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a "
"new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform "
"critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to "
"libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-"
"specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the "
"Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an "
"extension or command language for that application."
