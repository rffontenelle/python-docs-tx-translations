Commands for maintaining language repository
============================================

This document contains instructions to guide you on managing your language repository, hence helping you to translate Python's documentation to your language.

These commands are written as in Linux Shell, and should work in Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL), but feel free to use the same logic in other languages e.g. Python.

Note: Where you see ``${LANGCODE}`` in the commands below, replace it with your language code (e.g. 'uk', 'pt_BR') or set that variable (e.g. ``LANGCODE=pt_BR``) before running the commands.

Clone CPython repository
------------------------

It is necessary to have a local clone of CPython's source code repository in order to update translation files and to build translated documentation.

From inside your language repository, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   BRANCH=3.11
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/python/cpython --branch $BRANCH

``--depth 1`` do a shallow clone, which avoid downloading all the 800 MB of data from CPython's repository.

Optionally, you could also add ``--no-single-branch`` to git clone command which would make all branches available, allowing to switch between one branch and another. But there is no need if you are working in the translation of a single branch.


Install requirements
--------------------

Creating virtual environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Optionally, create a virtual environment (short: venv) to keep all Python package installations in it, then activate this venv to make sure commands are run from it:

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate

Install Python packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update pip and then install the Python requirements:

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install sphinx-intl>=2.1.0 pomerge powrap sphinx-lint

Alternatively, put all Python packages inside a requirements.txt file and install it using pip's ``-r`` flag.

Transifex CLI tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the Transifex CLI client, required to interact with Transifex:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd .venv/bin
   curl -s -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/transifex/cli/master/install.sh
   cd ../..

Note: the above statements cause ``tx`` binary to be downloaded into .venv/bin directory. Feel free to install this tool wherever you want, but preferably in a directory already in the PATH so that issuing  ``tx`` works without its full path.


Updating the translations
-------------------------

For language teams that coordinate translation efforts in Transifex, updating translation means pulling the translation strings.

Recommended: Before pulling translations, consider updating the .tx/config to have an up-to-date mapping of project/resources. For this, it is required to generate the documentation's pot files (template of po files), so start with the pot. Alternatively, you can skip it and pull translations, but new translation resources in Transifex could be not mapped, hence wouldn't be pulled.

Generating pot files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's use Sphinx's gettext builder for generating pot files:

.. code-block:: shell

   make -C cpython/Doc/ ALLSPHINXOPTS='-E -b gettext -D gettext_compact=0 -d build/.doctrees . locales/pot' build

Now, there should be a cpython/Doc/locales/pot/ containing all the pot files.

Generating .tx/config file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having the pot files, make use of sphinx-intl to generate the .tx/config:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd cpython/Doc/locales
   sphinx-intl create-txconfig
   sphinx-intl update-txconfig-resources \
       --transifex-organization-name python-doc \
       --transifex-project-name=python-newest \
       --locale-dir . --pot-dir pot

This step should take some time to finish. Once it is done, there should be a cpython/Doc/locales/.tx/config containing the list of resources based on the pot files previously generated.

As a final touch, we copy the .tx/config into the language repository making proper tweaks so one can download translations from Transifex or upload local translation changes, all this from repository's root directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd ../../..   # back to language repository root directory
   mkdir -p .tx
   sed cpython/Doc/locales/.tx/config \
       -e "s|^file_filter  = .*|&\nx&|;" \
       -e "s|^source_file  = pot/|source_file  = cpython/Doc/locales/pot/|" \
       > .tx/config
   sed -i .tx/config \
       -e "s|^xfile_filter  = ./<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/|trans.${LANGCODE}  = |;"

Remapping translation and Transifex resources is done.

Pulling the translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, let's download translations from Transifex using Transifex CLI tool:

.. code-block:: shell

   tx pull -l ${LANGCODE} -t -f

Command explanations:

* ``-l ${LANGCODE}`` – specify the language code so that tx doesn't pull all languages.
* ``-t`` – specify that we want translations
* ``-f`` – force pulling all files, because without this sometimes changes in Transifex are not downloaded

Wrapping the translation files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After pulling, it is highly recommended to use powrap in the po files to keep a better look:

.. code-block:: shell

   powrap --quiet *.po **/*.po

Alternatively, you can use ``--modified`` flag to save time and apply only to changed files.


Commit and push translation changes
-----------------------------------

The following commands are recommended for committing and pushing your translations to the your language repository.

.. code-block:: shell

   git diff -I'^"POT-Creation-Date: ' --numstat *.po **/*.po | cut -f3 | xargs -r git add
   git add $(git ls-files -o --exclude-standard *.po **/*.po) .tx/config
   git diff-index --quiet HEAD || { git commit -m "Update translations" && git push; }

It is not recommended to simply "git add" (stage) all PO files because this would also staged and commit the translation files that have only irrelevant changes in their POT-Creation-Date header field (i.e. date when the PO was updated against the POT).

The first command first git-add modified tracked files that does **not** exclusively match changes in POT-Creation-Date header, hence relevant changes are included.

The second command will git-add untracked po files that may have been newly created on the latest 'tx pull' run. It also adds .tx/config file.

The last command will only commit and push if any file was git-added in the above commands.


Build translated documentation
------------------------------

Useful for testing the translations, spotting syntax errors and viewing the result of your contribution.

To build translated documentation, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   cp --parents *.po **/*.po cpython/Doc/locales/${LANGCODE}/LC_MESSAGES/
   make -C cpython/Doc venv
   make -C cpython/Doc SPHINXOPTS="--keep-going -D gettext_compact=0 -D language=${LANGCODE}" html

The first command copies the translation files (.po) into cpython's locale_dir, which is required for it to be recognized.

Then create CPython's virtual environment using the Makefile from CPython's Doc directory:

Finally, build using the Makefile from CPython's Doc directory. Here is an explanation of the arguments used:

* ``-C cpython/Doc`` – changes the current directory to run the make command
* ``SPHINXOPTS`` – this variable should contain any CLI modifier command you want to pass
* ``--keep-going`` – even if it fails, go all way to the end to bring up all errors
* ``-D gettext_compact=0`` – override sphinx settings to consider one PO file == one doc page
* ``-D language=$LANGCODE`` – override sphinx settings to build in the desired ``$LANGCODE``
* ``html`` – the Makefile target that triggers the Sphinx's html builder


Viewing the documentation in a web browser
-----------------------------------------

Just build translated documentation and then open in the browser, no secrets. See below a one-line command to use your default web browser to open the index.html:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -c "import os, webbrowser; webbrowser.open('file://cpython/Doc/build/html/index.html')"

Notice how index.html could be replaced with any page, e.g. 'library/os.html'.


Linting the translation files
-----------------------------

``sphinx-lint`` is great to spot translation errors that will didn't spot e.g. trailing whitespace in the string, reST directive not properly surrounded with whitespace, etc. It's highly recommended.

.. code-block:: shell

   sphinx-lint *.po **/*.po


Merging translations into another branch
----------------------------------------

This is useful when you want to replicate a translation from the CPython branch currently being translated to another older branch. E.g. 3.11 is currently being translated, but 3.10 has that same string and could make use of the translation contributed.

.. code-block:: shell

   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
   TARGET_BRANCH=3.10
   pomerge --from-files *.po **/*.po
   git checkout ${TARGET_BRANCH}
   pomerge --to-files *.po **/*.po

After the above command, the translation from the current branch were applied to the previous branch "3.10". Now, let's make sure lines are wrapped:

.. code-block:: shell

   powrap --modified *.po **/*.po

Done changing, let's commit and push these changes, and go back the original branch:

.. code-block:: shell

   git diff -I'^"POT-Creation-Date: ' --numstat *.po **/*.po | cut -f3 | xargs -r git add
   git diff-index --quiet HEAD || { git commit -m "Merge translations into ${TARGET_BRANCH}" && git push; }
   git checkout ${CURRENT_BRANCH}
