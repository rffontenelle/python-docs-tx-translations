Guidance for New Contributors to Python Documentation Translation on Transifex
==============================================================================

This guide is intended for language teams working on the Python documentation within the python-doc_ organization on Transifex_. Yes: not all teams translate on Transifex, so using Transifex is optional.

Getting Started with Python Documentation Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are new to the translation of Python documentation, we recommend that you start by reading the Translating_ on `Python Developer's Guide`_ (a.k.a. devguide), joining the relevant contact channels, and familiarizing yourself with `PEP 545`_.

If there is already a repository for your language team, please join and introduce yourself to the team.

**If there is no existing repository or language team, you will need to create one.** Simply translating on Transifex is not enough to have your language published in the Python documentation. Please follow the instructions on starting a new translation.

Geting to Know Transifex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are new to Transifex, it is recommended that you take the time to read through the following resources from the Transifex documentation:

- `Getting started as a translator <https://help.transifex.com/en/articles/6248698-getting-started-as-a-translator>`_: This covers signing up for an account and joining translation team.
- `Translating with the Web Editor <https://help.transifex.com/en/articles/6318216-translating-with-the-web-editor>`_: This covers getting to the editor, searching and filtering strings, and translating strings.
- `Other Tools in the Editor <https://help.transifex.com/en/articles/6318944-other-tools-in-the-editor>`_: This covers the history, glossary, comments, keyboard shortcuts, and more.
- `Starting with the basics <https://help.transifex.com/en/collections/3441044-starting-with-the-basics>`_: A group of documents with basic information.


Transifex Does Not Update docs.python.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Language teams must download and store the translation files in their VCS repository, as per instructions from Translating_ on `Python Developer's Guide`_, as it is from this repository that the python-docs infrastructure will fetch translations, build the translated docs, and publish them on docs.python.org.

Projects within python-doc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The python-doc_ organization contains several projects, each representing the documentation for a specific version of Python (e.g. 3.10). The "Python" project (slug "python-newest") is the latest version available for translation. All other projects are named "Python <version>".


The Latest Version for Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Python" project in Transifex always contains the latest stable release of Python or its latest beta/RC release, but not alpha releases. For example, if the latest version is 3.11, the "Python" project will only be updated with strings from the 3.12 branch when a beta is released.


Translate the Latest Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Translations are propagated across projects for the same string, meaning that you only need to translate once and all versions of the Python documentation will receive the contribution *if the string remains unchanged*. If a string has changed between versions, the contribution will not be applied to the new version.

It is recommended to focus your translation efforts on the "Python" project, which represents the newest version. Keep in mind that the Python documentation contains a large number of strings and that translations will be propagated, so older versions will receive most contributions. Additionally, translating the newest version is more important as it will have fewer differences from the source string and receive more contributions.


Placeholders
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When translating in Transifex, you will encounter strings with `custom placeholders <placeholders.rst>`_ in the form of Sphinx roles (e.g. \:class:\`turtle`). These placeholders help highlight the role of specific elements, making it easier to translate them correctly and avoid warnings from Transifex if they are translated incorrectly.

For instance, if the source string contains ``:class:`turtle```, the translation string should also include the same placeholder. If it's missing, Transifex will display a warning message.

Occasionally, you may encounter false-positives in the warnings. It is important to check these warnings before ignoring them to ensure accuracy.

Final words
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended that you also follow the style guide for your language and review any existing translations to understand the tone and style of the language team. Translating the Python documentation can be a large project, and contributions from many members of the community are appreciated. If you need help or have questions, please reach out to the language team or any other contact channel provided in Translating_ on `Python Developer's Guide`_, or contact the python-doc project coordinators on Transifex.
