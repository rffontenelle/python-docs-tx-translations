"The notation is a mixture of `EBNF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form>`_ and `PEG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Parsing_expression_grammar>`_. In particular, ``&`` followed by a symbol, "
"token or parenthesized group indicates a positive lookahead (i.e., is "
"required to match but not consumed), while ``!`` indicates a negative "
"lookahead (i.e., is required _not_ to match).  We use the ``|`` separator to "
"mean PEG's \"ordered choice\" (written as ``/`` in traditional PEG grammars)."
