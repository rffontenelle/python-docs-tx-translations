"2to3 is a Python program that reads Python 2.x source code and applies a "
"series of *fixers* to transform it into valid Python 3.x code.  The standard "
"library contains a rich set of fixers that will handle almost all code.  "
"2to3 supporting library :mod:`lib2to3` is, however, a flexible and generic "
"library, so it is possible to write your own fixers for 2to3.  :mod:"
"`lib2to3` could also be adapted to custom applications in which Python code "
"needs to be edited automatically."
